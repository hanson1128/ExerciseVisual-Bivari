## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.








-------For Heat order exercise----------

```{r heatDescending, eval=FALSE}
# heatplot
base  = ggplot(df.C, aes(x = Daytime, y = reorder(Crime, -Percent), fill = Percent)) 
heat1 = base +  geom_tile() 
heat2 = heat1 +scale_fill_gradient(low = "yellow", 
                                   high = "purple")
heat2
```
